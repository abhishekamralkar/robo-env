This repo is the home of my custom system configuration which enables a consistent computing experience across multiple machines.  

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].  This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stow .
#+END_SRC
